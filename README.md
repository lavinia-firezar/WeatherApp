After downloading or cloning the project, you can run the following commands:

npm install
npm start

I used the API from Open Weather Map.
The app is deployed at following link:  https://weather-app-react-forecast.netlify.app/

The project has the following features:
•	Display the current weather;
•	Display the weather forecast for 5 days;
•	Adding some cities to your favorite section and deleting them;


The project is realised with following concepts:
•	Reusable components;
•	React hooks (useState, useEffect);
•	React Bootstrap;
•	CSS Modules;
•	API requests(fetch);
• State Management(useContext, useReducer)
